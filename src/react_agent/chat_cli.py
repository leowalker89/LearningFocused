"""React Agent CLI - Simple terminal chat interface.

Purpose:
    Interactive chat loop for testing the react agent.
    Simpler than deep_research_agent CLI since we don't have
    clarification phases, supervisors, or multi-stage output.
    
Features:
    - Colored output (ANSI codes) for readability
    - Streams tool calls and final responses
    - Type 'exit' or Ctrl+C to quit
    
Usage:
    uv run python -m src.react_agent.chat_cli
